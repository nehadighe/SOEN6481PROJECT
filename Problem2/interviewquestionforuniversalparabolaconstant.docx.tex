\newcounter{numberedCntA}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is your area of interest in your research in the Systems 
Research Institute?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - Discrete Mathematics

\ \ \ \ 

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item What is the purpose of using this constant in your field of 
expertise
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - In the research area of Physics it is widely used.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item How is the value of the universal parabola constant calculated ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - P = ln(1+?2)+ ?2

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item How frequently is it used?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - It is not much used, but used for specific applications.It is a 
complex exponential function and is ubiquitous in physics and comes into 
all sorts of models of dynamics via Fourier analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item How is the value of the Universal Parabola constant applied?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - The average distance from a point randomly selected in the unit 
square to its center

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Is there any application in which you are using this constant ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - Yes

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Can you describe the application which uses this constant more ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - A맗arabolic antenna말s an마ntenna맚hat uses a맗arabolic reflector, 
a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a맗arabola, to direct 
theradio waves.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Can you explain briefly the working of the application you know ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - The operating principle of a parabolic antenna is that a point 
source of radio waves at the맍ocal point말n front of a paraboloidal 
reflector of맊onductive material will be reflected into a맊ollimated 
plane wave막eam along the axis of the reflector in which the parabola 
constant is used.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Are there any difficulties computing this constant in the 
mathematical derivations in any application ? 
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - Yes



\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Can you explain the disadvantages of it then ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - ? and만마re ubiquitous in mathematics, science, and engineering.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item In the application which were studying on for deriving the 
formula, and computation, what was the duration needed for the 
computation
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - 9-10 months with lots of permutation and combination.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Can you explain which applications in your research area was using 
this constant ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - Projectile motion말s a form of맔otion experienced by an object or 
particle (a맗rojectile) that is thrown near the Earth's surface and 
moves along a curved path under the action of많ravity맖nly (in 
particular, the effects of마ir resistance마re assumed to be 
negligible).

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\thenumberedCntA}
\item Are there any other fields except this in which this constant is 
used ?
\setcounter{numberedCntA}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}
Ans - Mathematical Physics
